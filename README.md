# Emotion Recognition and Emotion Flip Reasoning Tasks

## Overview

This project involves two main tasks: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) and Emotion Flip Reasoning (EFR). Each task requires training multiple models with different architectures, evaluating their performance, and providing detailed reports and deliverables.

### Task 1: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC)

#### What is ERC?
Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) focuses on identifying and interpreting the emotional states expressed by individuals during conversations. Unlike traditional emotion analysis, ERC aims to understand the nuanced emotional dynamics in conversational exchanges involving multiple speakers.

### Task 2: Emotion Flip Reasoning (EFR)

#### What is EFR?
Emotion Flip Reasoning (EFR) aims to identify utterances within a dialogue that cause a speaker's emotional state to change. This task can involve shifts prompted by other speakers or by the individual's own utterances.

## Evaluation Metrics

### For ERC:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions among the total number of cases.
- **Macro-F1 Score**: Calculates the F1 score for each class and averages them.

### For EFR:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions among the total number of cases.
- **Macro-F1 Score**: Similar to ERC, calculating the F1 score for each class and averaging them.

### Evaluation:
- **Inference Pipeline**: Prepare an inference pipeline that can load model checkpoints and generate predictions.

This project involves a comprehensive approach to understanding and detecting emotions and their shifts in conversations, leveraging advanced NLP models and techniques.
